# Optimisation of Visitor Experience at Universal Studios Singapore
An Excel model was built with the aim of maximising visitors' experience at the Universal Studios Singapore (USS) by minimising their total queue and travel time between rides. The model takes in inputs like day of visit, time of visit and ride preferences etc. and returns the optimised itinerary for the visitor.
<br>
<br>
For building the model, real-time queue time and distances between rides were first collected to simulate and generate the average queue time and travel time between rides. Then, solver and permutation lookup methods were used to generate the optimised itinerary for the visitor. Macros were also used to build the user interface for the model.

## Data Sources
The following public data sources are used for this project:
<br>1. **Universal Studios Singapore App**: Real-time queue times for attractions
<br>2. **[Prepare Travel Plans Website](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Occupational-Wages-Tables2021.aspx)**: Estimation of ride duration
<br>3. **Google Maps**: Estimated distance between rides
<br>4. **[Research study by Browning et al. (2006)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7556034_Effects_of_obesity_and_sex_on_the_energetic_cost_and_preferred_speed_of_walking)**: Average walking pace

## File Description
This project includes two excel files, one being the simulation of queue times and the other being the main model file.
